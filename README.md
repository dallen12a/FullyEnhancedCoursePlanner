# FullyEnhancedCoursePlanner

The Python code of the updated course planner served as the base. The original program only loaded the CSV file and allowed printing of courses and prerequisites. The enhanced program allows a logged out user to load in the default CSV file into a course database. The logged out user would still be able to print and view courses and their prerequisites. Once logged in and verified through a user database, the user can add, remove, or reset the course database. If logged in as an administrator, user accounts can be added and deleted.
